Shared Dependencies:

1. **Node Class**: A base class for nodes that will be used across all files. This class will define the basic properties and methods of a node, such as its ID, type, input and output connections, and methods for adding and removing connections.

2. **Graph Class**: A class representing the graph of nodes. This will be used in the execution engine for running the graph, and in the node editor for displaying and editing the graph.

3. **Node Types**: A list or enumeration of all possible node types. This will be used in the node editor for creating new nodes, and in the execution engine for executing nodes.

4. **Error Types**: A list or enumeration of all possible error types. This will be used in the error handling module for categorizing and logging errors.

5. **Data Types**: A list or enumeration of all possible data types that can be passed between nodes. This will be used in the data flow module for ensuring that data is correctly passed between nodes.

6. **GUI Elements**: IDs of DOM elements used in the GUI interface, such as buttons for adding and deleting nodes, input fields for editing node properties, and areas for displaying the graph and errors.

7. **Event Names**: Names of events used in the GUI interface, such as events for adding and deleting nodes, changing node properties, and running the graph.

8. **Function Names**: Names of functions used across multiple modules, such as functions for adding and deleting nodes, changing node properties, running the graph, and handling errors.

9. **Test Names**: Names of unit tests corresponding to the various modules and functions.

10. **Documentation Sections**: Names of sections in the user and developer documentation, corresponding to the various modules and features of the application.

11. **Demo Elements**: Names of elements used in the demo, such as sample nodes and graphs.
